    <p>A tough away battle against Oriented Birds FC, currently second on the log, ended in a 0-0 draw.

Both teams played with great intensity, but neither could break the deadlock. Our defense stood strong, and we created a few chances, but the game remained evenly matched throughout. It was a hard-earned point against strong opposition, and the team showed resilience in a difficult away environment.

We'll take the positives from this performance as we continue to fight for every point in the ABC Motsepe League.</p>

    <h3>22 March 2025 | Beaufort West, WC</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately, we suffered a 1-0 defeat away to Ubuntu Spartans FC in a hard-fought match.

The game was tight, but a penalty early in the second half was enough to seal the win for the opposition. Despite putting in a solid performance and creating a few chances, we couldn’t find the equalizer.

It’s a disappointing result, but we’ll regroup, learn from this experience, and come back stronger in the next match.</p>

    <p>A tough day at the office as we fell 1-3 at home to Seaside Spur FC despite a strong start.

We took an early 1-0 lead with a great goal from Rashidi in the opening minutes of the first half. However, the opposition responded quickly, equalizing just moments later, and then things took a turn as Seaside Spur added two more goals, leaving us 1-3 down at halftime.

We tried to regroup in the second half, but the damage was done, and we couldn’t find a way back into the game. It was a disappointing result, but we’ll learn from it and bounce back stronger.</p>
