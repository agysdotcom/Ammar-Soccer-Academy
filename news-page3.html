    <h2>Matchday 10: Hard-Fought Away Victory!</h2>
    <h3>24 January 2025 | Thornton, Cape Town</h3>
    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507525428034-b723cf961d3e?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=80" alt="New website" />
    <p>A massive 2-1 away win against Santos FC in a game full of drama, penalties, and key tactical changes!</p>
    <p>We started strong, taking the lead in the first half through a coolly converted penalty by Lysakhanya. However, Santos responded with a penalty of their own‚Äîscoring on their second attempt after missing the first. The teams went into halftime locked at 1-1.

In the second half, tactical changes from the coach proved to be the difference. The introduction of De Flandre shifted the momentum as he drew two red cards from the opposition, forcing them down to nine men. With the numerical advantage, Caleb came off the bench to deliver the winning goal and secure another crucial three points!

A fantastic team performance and another step forward in our ABC Motsepe League journey! Thank you to our traveling supporters‚Äîyour energy pushed us to the finish line!</p>

    <p>We kicked off 2025 with a dramatic 1-0 victory at home against Maties FC, thanks to a late strike from Fu‚Äôaad in the dying moments of the game!</p>
    <p>The match took an early twist when Maties FC were reduced to 10 men in the first half after a dangerous tackle, giving us the numerical advantage. Despite this, our opponents remained compact and made it difficult for us to break through.</p>
    <p>We kept pushing, and just when it seemed like the points would be shared, Fu‚Äôaad stepped up with a clutch finish to secure all three points!

A fantastic way to start the year, and a big thank you to our incredible fans for their support! Onward and upward!</p>

    <p>As the year comes to an end, we close off 2024 sitting in 7th place on the standings with 9 points after 7 matches played. It has been a season of growth, learning, and fighting spirit as we continue to establish ourselves in the ABC Motsepe League.</p>

    <p>Despite a strong start, our team suffered a disappointing 1-2 defeat at home against Royal Blues Soccer FC.</p>
    <p>We took the lead early and controlled much of the first half, heading into the break 1-0 up and full of confidence. However, the second half saw the momentum shift, as our opponents fought back and managed to score twice, turning the game around and denying us any points from the match.</p>
    <p>A tough result to take, but we learn, regroup, and come back stronger. Thank you to our fans for the continued support‚Äîwe keep pushing forward!</p>

    <p>Our team showed immense fighting spirit in a tough away fixture against Infantry School FC, securing a 1-1 draw despite playing with 10 men.</p>
    <p>After a goalless first half, the game took a challenging turn as we were reduced to 10 men. Our opponents capitalized on the advantage and broke the deadlock, putting us under pressure. However, we responded immediately, with Fu‚Äôaad stepping up to score the equalizer and ensure we walked away with a hard-earned point.</p>
    <p>A true show of resilience from the squad, proving once again that we are ready to fight for every result.</p>
